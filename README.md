# csvDataVisualisation
*university assignment, got full mark so might as well showcase this one :)*


this is a simple python code using numpy to compute variance between two data set
also capable to compare multiple sets at a time
it then uses matplotlib to plot the computed data for visulisation purpose
more detail please refer to comment in the code

### Steps to run:
1. Put both file in the same directory
2. In terminal run `python3 randData.py` to auto-generate random .csv file set
   (act1.csv / exp1.csv etc. for comparing actual data and expected data)
3. Copy the command that's been printed out
4. Run Python in terminal (or use any preferred IDE)
5. Import the main module by typing `import plot`
6. Make sure numpy and matploitlib are properly installed
7. Run command `plot.plotmicrocar([],[])` <-paste command from step 4
